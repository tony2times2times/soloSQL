In this challenge, we’re going to practice performing SQL queries. This should help solidify some concepts that were covered during lecture.

# Assumptions

* You are using Postico or pgAdmin
* Postgres is currently running on your computer

# Setup
Follow the instructions below before continuing with this challenge.

## Create your database, table, and data

We are creating a database with a single table (syntax_practice) and 8 records. Please follow the instructions below to create a new database with this table and data.

### Postico instructions

1. Open Postico.
2. Create a local connection to your Postgres server, if needed.
3. Click the button in the upper left with the elephant icon, to get back to the list of databases/
4. Create a new database using the button at the bottom.
5. Double click your new DB.
6. Double click SQL query.
7. Paste everything from this file ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B10Wu-zrSBwMODZMbHZ1UUNPejQ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B10Wu-zrSBwMODZMbHZ1UUNPejQ/view?usp=sharing)) into the upper textbox
8. Press `cmd + option +  enter` or select Connection -> Execute All Queries.
9. Press `cmr + R` or select Connection -> Reload.

### pgAdmin instructions
1. Open pgAdmin, if needed
2. Connect to your server, if needed
3. Right-click on the `Databases` option (listed just under the icon that represents your server) and click `New Database…`
4. In the dialog, give your database a table named Pi
5. Click on the `SQL` tab/button
6. Uncheck the `Read only` option
7. Paste everything from this file ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B10Wu-zrSBwMODZMbHZ1UUNPejQ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B10Wu-zrSBwMODZMbHZ1UUNPejQ/view?usp=sharing)) into a textbox
8. Click `OK` to create our database, table, and data!

## GitHub repo
1. Create a GitHub repo named “prime-solo-sql”.
2. Create a file called “solution.sql”. You will store your responses to the exercise questions here. NOTE: This is merely a text file with a .sql extension.

# Exercise

For each of the following questions

* Write a comment that specifies which question you are answering. (SQL comments are two dashes, followed by text.)
* Write the SQL query that answers the question, below that comment.

## Example question and answer
```
-- 0. Get all the users
SELECT * FROM syntax_practice;
```

# Tasks
1. Get all users from Chicago.
2. Get all users with usernames that contain the letter a.
3. The bank is giving a new customer bonus! Update all records with an account balance of 0.00 and a transactions_attempted of 0. Give them a new account balance of 10.00.
4. Select all users that have attempted 9 or more transactions.
5. Get the username and account balance of the 3 users with the highest balances, sort highest to lowest balance. NOTE: Research LIMIT
6. Get the username and account balance of the 3 users with the lowest balances, sort lowest to highest balance.
7. Get all users with account balances that are more than $100.
8. Add a new record.
9. The bank is losing money in Miami and Phoenix and needs to unload low transaction customers: Delete users that reside in miami OR phoenix and have completed fewer than 5 transactions.
